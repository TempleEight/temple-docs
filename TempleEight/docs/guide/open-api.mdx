An OpenAPI specification describes an API in a standardised format, including:

- available endpoints
- request and response contents
- authentication required for the API

OpenAPI is very well documented, so although we'll be walking you through one specific example in this guide, you'll find lots more on the [OpenAPI documentation pages](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

For this example, we'll be showing you how to make requests to the `ExampleService` project we defined in the [Getting Started](../getting-started) guide, from an iOS application.

We'll assume you have some prerequisites installed:

- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [OpenAPI generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

We'll also assume you have some understanding of Swift, although it's syntax is very straightforward, so shouldn't pose too much of a challenge.
[A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html) can be found on the official Swift website.


## Generating the Client Library

The project we generated as part of the [getting started](../getting-started) contains an `api` folder, which contains a single `YAML` file:

```
api
└── example-project.openapi.yaml
```

This file is the OpenAPI description of the generated server, detailing all of the available endpoints, as well as their associated request and response bodies.

We can generate a Swift client for this description using the following command:

```bash
❯❯❯ openapi-generator generate -i api/example-project.openapi.yaml -g swift4 -o ~/Desktop/example-openapi

```
This generates a new folder on the desktop with the OpenAPI client inside.

## Setting up an Xcode Project
Next we'll setup a fresh Xcode project that uses this library.

First, open Xcode, and from the menu bar select File > New > Project:
<img alt="Create a new Xcode project" src={useBaseUrl('img/xcode-new-project.png')} />

Then select Single View App:
<img alt="Create a new iOS App" src={useBaseUrl('img/xcode-new-ios.png')} />

Fill in your project details as necessary and save the project:
<img alt="Create a new iOS App" src={useBaseUrl('img/xcode-new-ios-detail.png')} />

Now - close the Xcode window that just appeared and reopen your terminal.
Move to your Xcode project directory and enter the following command:

```bash
# Move to your Xcode project directory
❯❯❯ cd ~/Desktop/ExampleClient

# Create a new Cocoapod project
❯❯❯ pod init
```

This will have created a `Podfile` similar to the following:


```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'ExampleClient' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  Teuse_frameworks!

  # Pods for ExampleClient

end
```

We're going to add 2 dependencies to our Podfile: one for [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), a HTTP library, and another to our generated client library.
The path to the generated client library must match the `-o` argument to `openapi-generator` from the previous step.


```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'ExampleClient' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for ExampleClient
  pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.9.0'
  pod 'OpenAPIClient', :path => '~/Desktop/example-openapi'

end
```

Following this, install the dependencies with:

```bash
# Install the Pod dependencies 
❯❯❯ pod install
```

This will instruct you to use the `.xcworkspace` generated in this directory from now on, which we will now open in Xcode:

<img alt="Xcode workspace" src={useBaseUrl('img/xcode-workspace.png')} />

All of the code will be written in this class from now on, but if you're a Swift expert, feel free to create your own.

## Starting the server for local development

Before we get started writing our client, we need to deploy the Temple project for local development.
This can be done by following the [Getting Started](../getting-started) guide, or from the root of the generated Temple project folder, by running the following commands:


```bash
# Deploy the services for local development
❯❯❯ source deploy.sh

# Find the base URL to make requests to
❯❯❯ echo $KONG_ENTRY
localhost:8000
```

This second step gave us the base URL where requests to our API can be made.

## Using the Client API

Now, back in the Xcode project, we can tell the client where to make requests by settings the `basePath` property of the client, like so:


```swift
import UIKit
import OpenAPIClient

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        OpenAPIClientAPI.basePath = "http://localhost:8000/api"
    }
}
```

Now we can make a sample call to the `ExampleService`, as follows:

```swift
import UIKit
import OpenAPIClient

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        OpenAPIClientAPI.basePath = "http://localhost:8000/api"
        ExampleServiceAPI.exampleServicePost(inlineObject: InlineObject(foo: "hello", bar: 123)) { (response, error) in
            guard let response = response else {
                fatalError(error.debugDescription)
            }
            print(response)
        }
    }
}

```

Here we make a `POST` request, passing the parameters `"hello"` and `123` for `foo` and `bar` respectively.
We then also include a callback, which checks that the response exists otherwise causes a `fatalError`.
If it does exist, we output it to the console.


## Allowing a `localhost` Connection
Since iOS only allows to make requests from URLs which are secure, we have to make a slight modification to the project in order to make a `localhost` service accessible.

From the project overview on the left of the Xcode window, open `Info.plist` and add the key "App Transport Security Settings", which should then contain the key "Allow Arbitrary Loads", set to "YES". 
Your final `Info.plist` should resemble:


<img alt="Update the info.plist" src={useBaseUrl('img/xcode-transport.png')} />


## Building the Project
We can now go ahead and build the Xcode project, by going to the Menu Bar: Product > Run
<img alt="Update the info.plist" src={useBaseUrl('img/xcode-run.png')} />

:::important
When building the Xcode project you might find an error that resembles:
```
Protocol type 'Any' cannot conform to 'Decodable' because only concrete types can conform to protocols
```

This is an issue with the OpenAPI generator for Swift.
A simple workaround is to find the offending line, by double clicking the error message, and replace occurences of the type `Any` in that function with `[String: String]`

:::

After the simulator eventually boots, you should see an output in the Xcode console which resembles a successful response:

```
InlineResponse200(id: Optional(7363A1A9-8420-11EA-B33F-0242C0A83003), foo: Optional("hello"), bar: Optional(123.0))
```
